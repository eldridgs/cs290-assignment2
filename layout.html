            <p>This is some great paragraph writing.  My favorite thing about paragraphs is that they are neat.  Some people think all paragraphs are only three to five sentences long.  They must not read much.  I like reading.  Books are nice, but I also have a kindle.  Right now I am reading "Game of Thrones."  I havent seen any of the television show so it hasn't been wrecked for my reading pleasure.  I haven't been doing as much joy reading as I would like since I started school, so hopefully I don't have to give up on this book.  My apartment is cold.  I got my electric bill today.  It was more than I wanted it it be.  Electric heat is not my friend.  Speaking of friends, I am going to Hood River on Saturday for a friend's birthday.  I arranged for everyone to pitch in some money to buy him a guitar.  He has been wanting to learn for a while now.  His girlfriend is worried that if she signs him up for lessons that he will skip them.  I don't see any reason he should do that.  He has no music knowledge at all.  I think they would be good for him at least as a starting point.  I have played guitar off and on since I was 21, but I don't think I am very good.  I should practice more.  I also want to learn drums, but I live in an apartment and drums are loud and frowned upon in this setting.</p>
            <p>Here's another paragraph.  I wonder how many types of cheese I can think of off the top of my head.  Let's see, there's gouda, cheddar, swiss, gueyere, parmesean, blue, feta, mozzerella, colby, jack...  That's not a very impressive list.  I haven't had any cheese since August.  I am forgetting all the kinds so fast!  My dog has had cheese, though.  Its her favorite treat.  We use it when I think she will be extra distracted.  My cat has no interest in cheese.  She isn't much of a snacker, but she really likes her cat food and cat tree.  She is rubbing my leg right now.  I think she may want some cat food.  My snake definitely does not eat cheese.  Snakes aren't able to digest anything cooked.  My snake is named Darcy.  She has been pretty active lately.  I wonder what she is thinking.  She is my second snake.  My dog is also my second dog.  My cat is my first cat, though.  I like all animals, but I guess I would consider myself a dog person.  Today my coworker said she hoped "I guess" would appear somewhere on my tombstone.  I guess I do say it more than the average human.  My dog is about to start squeaking her favorite toy.  Maybe I should quit with this crazy paragraph writing and hit the hay.  I have to see the dentist in the morning.  I hope that it isn't to be told I have a mouth full of cavities!</p>
